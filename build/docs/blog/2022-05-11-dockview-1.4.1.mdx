## ðŸ”¥ Breaking changes

All breaking changes here are designed to simplify the library with only one way to do something.

-   Remove `setVisible` and `setActive` from the Splitview API. You can still achieve the same behaviors through calling `setVisible` and `setActive` on the Splitview Panel API. [#105](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/105)
-   Remove `setVisible`, `setActive` and `toggleVisiblity` from Gridview API. You can still achieve the same behaviors through calling `setVisible` and `setActive` on the Gridview Panel API [#105](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/105)
-   Remove `onFocusEvent` from Panel API as this was not intended to be a public method. You can use `onDidFocusChange` instead [#105](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/105)
-   Remove HOC `<DockviewComponents.Panel\>`, `<DockviewComponents.Content>`, `<DockviewComponents.Tab>` and `<DockviewComponents.Actions>` [#105](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/pull/105)
